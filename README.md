menubar-proxy-switcher v1.0


About
-----

This is essentially a non-dock tool to run any written shell scripts from the ~~menubar~~ status bar as a shortcut (I just learnt it's called status bar!). 



Usage
-----

Click the icon in the status bar to switch the system socks proxy.


Do remember to input the password in shell scripts in file 'AppDelegate.swift'.



Future
------

Currently it's working as a proxy switch toggle for my private use. Let's see what we can do with it next.

# menubar-proxy-switcher

menubar-proxy-switcher v1.0

This is essentially a non-dock tool to run any written shell scripts from the ~~menubar~~ status bar as a shortcut (I just learnt it's called status bar!). 

Currently it's working as a proxy switch toggle for my private use. Let's see what we can do with it next.

Do remember to input the password in shell scripts in file 'AppDelegate.swift'.

to-do:  
  
  proxy status âˆš  
  keyboard shortcut
  icons update  
  proxystatus detection  
  password file input

# menubar-proxy-switcher

menubar-proxy-switcher v1.0

This is essentially a non-dock tool to run any written shell scripts from the menubar as a shortcut. 

Currently it's working as a proxy switch toggle for my private use. Let's see what we can do with it next.

Do remember to input the password in shell scripts in file 'AppDelegate.swift'.
to-do:
  proxy status √
  icons update
  proxystatus detection
  password file input

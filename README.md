# menubar-proxy-switcher

menubar-proxy-switcher v1.0

This is essentially a non-dock tool to run any written shell scripts from the menubar as a shortcut. 

Currently it's working as a proxy switch toggle for my private use. Let's see what we can do with it next.

Do remember to input the password in shell scripts in file 'AppDelegate.swift'.

to-do:

  feature: 
  
  ☑️ proxy state 
  
  icons update
